# Jackie's Multi-event Countdown React App
This project is a website built to countdown to my birthday, graduation date, and grad school application date. I used the Material-UI package for the first time ever, and I thought the theme was key to maintaining the same appearance and behavior throughout the application (e.g., give every grid/box component the color of my choosing). \
